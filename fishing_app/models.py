    # 'CharField' is used for short 'Strings' such as names or IDs, it has 2 main parameters:
    #     'max_length' which is obligatory, defines the string length.
    #     'blank' which is optional, it enables the string to be empty if declared as 'true'.

    # 'TextField' is used for long 'Strings', in this case, we'll use 'em for descriptions, it has one optional parameter; 'blank' which i did explain just before

    # 'SlugField' is used for a different type of 'Strings', it's meant to contain short URLs, it only allows letters, numbers, hyphens and underscore, it has max lenght and a new paramenter:
    #     'allow_unicode' which is optional, it enables unicode if it's set as true

    # 'EmailField' is used, obviously, for emails, it has max lenght.

    # 'URLField' Unlike slugfield, this one's meant to contain full large URLs

    # 'UUIDField' is used for universal unique IDs, it has one important parameter:
    #    'default', you can use 'uuid.uuid4' to generate a random value

    # 'FilePathField' is used to contain filepaths, which needs at least 1 important paramenter and another extra optional one
    #    'path' is obligatory, it's the path where the files will be stored.
    #    'match' is optional, it's a regular expression that will be used to filter the files that can be choosen
